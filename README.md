## Description

The landing page project is displayed as a static version in HTML and CSS and by using JavaScript, I made this project interactive and dynamic.

## What i did

In index.html I build four sections. Then in styles.css, I use Media Query to make my website more responsive and all features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
Finally, in app.js I declared the global variable that I needed. Then I build a navigation bar dynamically by creating the function nav that builds an unordered list. Last I activate the navigation bar and sections and I add an event scroll.

## Instructions

I did everything I could to make my code formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting. Also, I add comments before the code procedure.
